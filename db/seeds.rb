  review_text: "Look...copper but closer to gold with a quickly dissolving white head. completely clear
  Smell...the lightest of hints of the hop citrus and wheat. A wave of fresh grass
  Taste...reminiscent to me of a German pils but a little bit maltier and not as dry on the finish. A pillow like resolve at the end with some sweetness.
  Feel..Smooth and thin with a proper amount of carbonation giving an easy drinking
  Overall...I would not buy this too many times a year but I don't buy many non craft pilsners at all soo...It is great on a hot day and some good eats . great vacation beer or staycation . I gotta be honest these are cooler dwellers from vaca....so gifted cheers",

Pretty balanced overall - not too bitter or sweet, just the right amount of bubbles. Definitely one of the better adjuncts. High end lawn mower beer. It'll definitely do when icy cold!",

It's a step above your average adjunct lager. When I'm tired of the heaviness of stouts, and the bitterness of IPAs, I enjoy a glass of this beer. It reminds me of when I was young, having a beer with my dad, or drinking with my friends.",
